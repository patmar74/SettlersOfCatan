# SettlersOfCatan
A program that emulates the classic board game, Settlers of Catan

<h3>Good evening fellow classmates,</h3>
<p>If you'd like to work on this project directly please <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a>,
set up a GitHub account and let me know what your username is so that I can add you as a contributor.
Next you will need to create a new folder where you will keep your project, and copy the path of the folder by 
pressing Shift and Right-Click and selecting Copy as Path</p> 
Once git is installed please open the command line and enter the following commands:
Please note that you need to subsititue pathYouCopied for the actual path to the folder</p>
<p><code> cd pathYouCopied</code></p>
<p><code> git init</code></p>
<p>This initializes the folder as a git repository so you can start using this awesome version control software.</p>
<p><code> git remote add origin https://github.com/patmar74/SettlersOfCatan</code></p>
<p><code> git pull origin </code></p>
<p>This will pull the project and all it's branches to your locatal git repository (the folder your working in).
Now you can make any changes you'd like to the existing project. Once you've made your changes you have stage them for git by
entering the following in the command line:</p>
<p><code>git add *</code></p>
<p> Now that your changes are staged, you can go ahead and commit them. This means that git takes a snapshot of the project
at that time. Enter the following in the command line to commit your changes:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m "Message about what changed"</code></p>
