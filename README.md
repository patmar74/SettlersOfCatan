# SettlersOfCatan
A program that emulates the classic board game, Settlers of Catan

<h3>Good evening fellow classmates,</h3>
<p>If you'd like to work on this project directly please <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a>,
set up a GitHub account and let me know what your username is so that I can add you as a contributor.
Next you will need to create a new folder where you will keep your project, and copy the path of the folder by 
pressing Shift and Right-Click and selecting Copy as Path</p> 
Once git is installed please open the command line and enter the following commands:
Please note that you need to subsititue pathYouCopied for the actual path to the folder</p>
<p><code> cd pathYouCopied</code></p>
<p><code> git init</code></p>
<p>This initializes the folder as a git repository so you can start using this awesome version control software.</p>
<p><code> git remote add origin https://github.com/patmar74/SettlersOfCatan</code></p>
<p><code> git pull origin </code></p>
<p>This will pull the project and all it's branches to your local git repository (the folder your working in). Now switch to a
new branch by entering</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b branchName</code></p>
<p>and then push the new branch back to gitHub with the command below. You will be asked to provide your Github username and password</p>
<p><code>git push -u origin branchName</code></p>
<p>Now you can make any changes you'd like to the existing project. Once you've made your changes you have to stage them for git by entering the following in the command line:</p>
<p><code>git add *</code></p>
<p> Now that your changes are staged, you can go ahead and commit them. This means that git takes a snapshot of the project
at that time. Enter the following in the command line to commit your changes:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m "Message about what changed"</code></p>
<p>Once you've completed your changes and committed them you can go ahead and push it back to github</p>
<p><code>git push origin</code></p>
<p>Once that's done either submit a pull request in github or <a href="mailto:patmar74@gmail.com">email me</a> to let me know so that I can merge it with the master branch. If you have any questions please let me know.
If you are working on a branch with someone else you can fetch the changes that they make and merge them with yours by entering the command</p>
<p><code>git pull origin</code></p>
